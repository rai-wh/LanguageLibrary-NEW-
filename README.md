Reflection
I created this project for my 2022 Capstone at Nashville Software School, as well as giving myself access to an easier and more fun way to learn the language that I have been studying for about half a year. (Japanese).

I wanted to make a site that not only challenges your brain, but also gives you the satisfaction of actually enjoying the process of learning a language.

This project definitely threw me a few obstacles, such as learning how to implement an external API to provide the translations for each word/story/sentence, however it was a huge learning experience and definitely propelled not only my language learning skills, but also my coding skills.

The requirement for this project was implementing React to build the webpage, and I couldn't be happier with that decision. Learning and using React has taught me to think outside the box with my code after spending half a year learning Vanilla JS. Learning how to implement hooks and routes has kept my brain craving more and more regarding new tools that I can actively use while coding. All in all, this project contains methods from React, vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML to create a working page that can be easily accessible to anyone who tries to access the page.
